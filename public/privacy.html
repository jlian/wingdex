      <h2>1. Data We Process</h2>
      <p>WingDex stores birding records you create (such as outings, observations, and related metadata) to provide app functionality.</p>

      <h2>2. Photo Handling</h2>
      <p>Photos used for identification are processed by server-side AI endpoints and are not retained after processing, except as needed for active request handling.</p>

      <h2>3. Authentication Data</h2>
      <p>Authentication data is processed through configured identity methods (such as passkeys and social providers) to manage account access and security.</p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>WingDex may use third-party services for species media, geocoding, and hosting infrastructure. Those services may process limited request data.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Your account data is retained while your account remains active, unless removal is requested or required by law.</p>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>Reasonable measures are used to protect data, but no method of storage or transmission is guaranteed to be completely secure.</p>

      <h2>7. Changes and Contact</h2>
      <p>This policy may be updated over time. For privacy questions, contact the WingDex project maintainer via the GitHub repository issue tracker.</p>
