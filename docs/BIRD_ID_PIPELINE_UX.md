# Plan: Bird ID Pipeline & UX Improvements

**TL;DR**: Six issues across three work streams, all on `feat/bird-id-pipeline-ux`. Group 1 tackles bird ID performance (#183) and two-tier escalation (#125) together since they share the same pipeline. Group 2 fixes upload flow UX -- crop jank (#181), clustering (#187), post-ID toast/homepage (#185), and privacy messaging (#146). All changes converge in [src/components/flows/AddPhotosFlow.tsx](../src/components/flows/AddPhotosFlow.tsx) which is the central file.

---

## Group A: Bird ID Performance + Two-Tier Escalation (#183, #125)

**Steps**

- [x] **Remove the hard-coded 500ms delay** in [AddPhotosFlow.tsx](../src/components/flows/AddPhotosFlow.tsx#L117) -- `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 500))` before every inference call. Instant 500ms win.

- [x] **Eliminate the double base64 round-trip** -- Currently: data URL (base64) -> `dataUrlToBlob()` in [ai-inference.ts](../src/lib/ai-inference.ts#L48-L59) -> FormData upload -> server re-encodes to base64 in [identify-bird.ts](../functions/api/identify-bird.ts#L11-L25). Instead, send the base64 data URL string directly (e.g., as a JSON body field) so the server can pass it straight to OpenAI's vision API without re-encoding.

- [x] **Add `VISION_MODEL_STRONG` constant** in [bird-id.ts](../functions/lib/bird-id.ts#L7) -- `gpt-5-mini` as the strong model, keep `gpt-4.1-mini` as the fast model. Both configurable via env vars (`OPENAI_MODEL` / `OPENAI_MODEL_STRONG`).

- [x] **Add optional `model` parameter to server endpoint** -- [identify-bird.ts](../functions/api/identify-bird.ts) accepts an optional `model` field (`"fast"` or `"strong"`, default `"fast"`) which selects the appropriate model constant.

- [x] **Implement dual-condition escalation in `runSpeciesId()`** -- In [AddPhotosFlow.tsx](../src/components/flows/AddPhotosFlow.tsx), after the first (fast) call:
   - Escalate if top confidence < 0.75 OR gap between top-2 candidates < 0.15
   - Second call uses `model: "strong"`
   - Update processing message to indicate re-analysis

- [x] **Tune the vision prompt for calibrated confidence** -- In [bird-id-prompt.js](../functions/lib/bird-id-prompt.js), require at least 2 candidates, add calibration anchors (0.30-0.49 for poor views, 0.50-0.74 for partial/ambiguous, cap at 0.80 for backlit/distant), and add overconfidence penalty rules per the existing plan in issue #125. Iterate until results match expected confidence distributions on the existing fixture set, then capture a new fixture set with the tuned prompt for future regression testing.

- [x] **Add timing to fixture capture + re-capture** -- In [capture-llm-fixtures.mjs](../scripts/capture-llm-fixtures.mjs), record `durationMs` per fixture. Re-capture all fixtures with the tuned prompt. Verify confidence distribution uses the full range and wrong answers score lower. Capture timing for both fast and strong models to verify the expected ~3s vs ~6s difference.

- [x] **Replace static progress bar with time-estimated animation** -- Exponential asymptotic curve `progress = 90 * (1 - e^(-t/tau))` with tau calibrated from matrix latency data: tau=1200ms (fast, reaches ~70% at p50=1773ms) and tau=4400ms (strong, reaches ~70% at p50=6627ms). Progress indicator has 300ms ease-out CSS transition for smooth snap to 100% on completion. Resets with fresh runKey on escalation.

- [x] **Update tests** -- [ai-fixture-replay.test.ts](../src/__tests__/ai-fixture-replay.test.ts) for new fixture format (>=2 candidates, `durationMs`), [ai-inference.test.ts](../src/__tests__/ai-inference.test.ts) for model parameter passthrough.

- [x] **Refresh the fixture capture README** -- Updated [src/__tests__/fixtures/README.md](../src/__tests__/fixtures/README.md) with matrix-first refresh flow, baseline promotion commands, updated env requirements, and fixture field semantics.

- [x] **Consolidated fixture workflows into single script** -- [capture-llm-fixtures.mjs](../scripts/capture-llm-fixtures.mjs) handles capture, benchmark (6 variants), analysis, and promotion. Calls CF AI Gateway with production-matching image resize. Refresh flow:
    - `npm run fixtures:benchmark` (capture all variants)
    - `npm run fixtures:analyze` (compare results)
    - `npm run fixtures:promote -- <variant>` (promote to golden baseline)

## Group B: Crop Jank (#181)

**Steps**

- [x] **Increase `initCrop()` padding** -- In [image-crop-dialog.tsx](../src/components/ui/image-crop-dialog.tsx#L44-L66), increase the padding multiplier from 10% to ~30-40% so the AI-suggested crop starts zoomed out more, compensating for the model's imprecise birdCenter/birdSize. Clamp to image bounds.

- [x] **Fix aspect ratio drift in `handleResize`** -- At [image-crop-dialog.tsx](../src/components/ui/image-crop-dialog.tsx#L168-L177), the resize handler treats width and height independently despite `initCrop` forcing a square. Ensure the resize maintains the square constraint and re-centers properly.

- [x] **Update crop math tests** -- [image-crop-dialog.test.ts](../src/__tests__/image-crop-dialog.test.ts) for the new padding and resize behavior.

---

## Group C: Upload Flow UX (#187, #185, #146)

**Steps**

- [x] **Tighten clustering thresholds** -- In [clustering.ts](../src/lib/clustering.ts), reduce `TIME_THRESHOLD_MS` from 5 hours to ~2 hours and `MAX_DISTANCE_KM` from 6 to ~3. Verify with [clustering.test.ts](../src/__tests__/clustering.test.ts) that split scenarios pass and existing reasonable groupings still hold.

- [x] **Fix location auto-fill on outing decline** -- In [OutingReview.tsx](../src/components/flows/OutingReview.tsx#L83-L91), add a `useEffect` watching `useExistingOuting`: when the user toggles it to `false` and GPS data is available, trigger `fetchLocationName(roundedLat, roundedLon)` so the location field auto-fills instead of falling back to `defaultLocationName`.

- [x] **Improve post-ID toast messages** -- In [AddPhotosFlow.tsx `saveOuting()`](../src/components/flows/AddPhotosFlow.tsx#L229-L245):
    - Include the outing location name and species names in the success toast
    - For new dex species, show which species are new (e.g., "New to your WingDex: American Robin, Blue Jay!")
    - Consider using `toast()` with a description field for richer content

- [x] **Highlight recent outing on homepage** -- In [HomePage.tsx](../src/components/pages/HomePage.tsx), after `onClose()` returns the user to the homepage, scroll to / visually highlight the just-updated outing. Options: pass a `highlightOutingId` via navigation state, or rely on the recently-sorted list naturally showing it first with a brief highlight animation.

- [x] **Clarify photo hash messaging** -- Update three locations:
    - [SettingsPage.tsx](../src/components/pages/SettingsPage.tsx#L649): Change "Your photos are never stored" to mention that a fingerprint hash is stored for duplicate detection but the actual image is not retained
    - [AddPhotosFlow.tsx](../src/components/flows/AddPhotosFlow.tsx#L489): Update "Used for ID, never saved" to be more precise
    - [PrivacyPage.tsx](../src/components/pages/PrivacyPage.tsx#L48-L49): Add a sentence about the file hash in Section 4

## Group D: UX Polish (post-review, manual testing)

Iterative polish based on manual testing with real photos against the hosted dev server.

**Steps**

- [x] **Widen crop padding** -- In [crop-math.ts](../src/lib/crop-math.ts), increased `padRatio` default from 0.35 to 0.65 so the AI-suggested square crop starts zoomed out more, giving users more context around the bird.

- [x] **Show user's crop during progress** -- In [AddPhotosFlow.tsx](../src/components/flows/AddPhotosFlow.tsx), the processing/progress step now shows `croppedDataUrl` (the user's actual crop) instead of the raw thumbnail when available. Subtitle reads "Your photo (cropped)" when a user crop exists.

- [x] **Consistent confirm image sizes** -- Both the bird photo (left) and Wikipedia reference image (right) in the confirm step use `max-w-48 aspect-square` containers with `object-cover` for uniform visual weight regardless of source aspect ratio.

- [x] **Remove progress bar text** -- Stripped the percentage label from the progress indicator during identification. The animated bar alone communicates progress.

- [x] **Progress title says "Identifying..."** -- Changed the processing step heading from "Processing photo X of Y" to "Identifying photo X of Y..." for clearer intent.

- [x] **Large serif confidence number** -- Replaced the `Badge` pill with a large color-coded number (`text-3xl font-semibold font-serif`) that stands on its own. Colors: green (>=75%), yellow (>=50%), red (<50%).

- [x] **Remove photo dots from progress step** -- The dot indicators for multi-photo sets are hidden during the processing step to reduce visual clutter.

- [x] **Button styling cleanup** -- Confirm step buttons use default sizing (removed `size="sm"`) for better touch targets.

- [x] **Revert multipleBirds prompt** -- Reverted the `multipleBirds` field description in [bird-id-prompt.js](../functions/lib/bird-id-prompt.js) to the original wording from commit a79835a: flags multiple individuals regardless of species (colonies, flocks, perched groups), not just multiple species. This ensures cormorant flocks and similar scenes correctly trigger the multi-bird toast.

- [x] **Shared WikiBirdThumbnail component** -- Extracted a reusable [wiki-bird-thumbnail.tsx](../src/components/ui/wiki-bird-thumbnail.tsx) used by `HomePage.tsx`, `bird-row.tsx`, and `AddPhotosFlow.tsx`. Encapsulates `useBirdImage` hook, portrait-aware `object-position: center top`, and fallback `Bird` icon. Removes duplicated wiki image rendering logic.

- [x] **Confetti on new species** -- Added confetti animation (via [confetti.tsx](../src/components/ui/confetti.tsx)) that fires when a newly discovered species is confirmed. Fixed `firedRef` reset logic so confetti re-fires correctly across multiple new species in the same session. Added 1500ms `onClose` delay so confetti is visible before the dialog advances.

- [x] **Toast improvements** -- Lifer toast uses `toast()` with bird emoji prefix, stacks on top of the "Saved" `toast.success()` (Sonner stacks last-fired = topmost). Both toasts use 6000ms duration. multipleBirds toast shortened to "Multiple birds detected, crop to one".

---

## Verification

- [x] `npm test` -- all unit tests pass (552 tests across 32 files)
- [x] `npx playwright test` -- e2e smoke passes (36 passed, 0 failed)
- [x] Manual test: upload photos, observe faster ID, verify progress bar animates smoothly, check escalation triggers on low-confidence photos
- [x] Manual test: verify post-ID toast shows species names and homepage highlights the new outing
- [ ] Manual test: verify clustering produces tighter outings, declining outing merge auto-fills location
- [ ] Check privacy/settings pages for updated messaging

## Matrix Insights (latest run)

- Matrix config: 27 fixtures, 3 runs, 12 responses per image (2 sources x 2 models x 3 runs)
- Success counts:
    - `llm:fast` 81/81
    - `llm:strong` 81/81
    - `runtime:fast` 81/81
    - `runtime:strong` 80/81 (one transient `fetch failed` on `Unknown_bird_no_GPS`, run 1)
- Agreement:
    - fast top-1 match (LLM vs runtime): 75/81 = 92.59%
    - strong top-1 match (LLM vs runtime): 61/80 = 76.25%
    - multipleBirds agreement: 100% in both model tiers
- Latency (request ms medians):
    - `llm:fast` 1775 vs `runtime:fast` 1773
    - `llm:strong` 6604 vs `runtime:strong` 6731
- Tail behavior:
    - runtime strong max request latency reached 30533 ms (heavy-tail outlier)

## Remaining Work

- [x] **Progress bar calibration (#183/#125)** -- tau derived from matrix p50: 1200ms fast, 4400ms strong. Added 300ms ease-out transition for smooth completion snap.
- [x] **Fixture README update** -- documented in [src/__tests__/fixtures/README.md](../src/__tests__/fixtures/README.md).
- [x] **E2E verification** -- all 36 Playwright tests pass (fixed pre-existing broken assertions in csv-and-upload-integration e2e).
- [x] **UX polish round** -- crop padding, confirm layout, confetti, toasts, shared WikiBirdThumbnail, progress title, confidence display, button sizing (see Group D above).
- [ ] **Strong-tier stability follow-up** -- investigate runtime strong outliers and the single transient runtime failure (non-blocking, tracked separately).
- [ ] **Clustering/location manual test** -- verify tighter clustering and outing-decline location auto-fill with real data.
- [ ] **Privacy messaging review** -- verify settings/privacy pages reflect updated hash/photo messaging.

## Decisions

- **Model tiers**: gpt-4.1-mini (fast) -> gpt-5-mini (strong), both env-configurable
- **Photo hash**: keep feature, clarify messaging (not remove or make opt-in)
- **Escalation triggers**: confidence < 0.75 OR gap between top-2 < 0.15
- **Clustering thresholds**: tighten from 5h/6km to ~2h/~3km (exact values to calibrate against existing tests)
- **Progress bar**: exponential asymptotic curve capping at 90% until completion
- **Crop padding**: padRatio=0.65 (up from 0.35) for more context around bird
- **Confetti**: fires on new species discovery, resets correctly for multi-photo uploads
- **multipleBirds prompt**: flags multiple individuals regardless of species (reverted from species-only wording)
