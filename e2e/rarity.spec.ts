/**
 * The rarity mark, end to end, against the real shipped asset.
 *
 * The Discovery Park fixture is Seattle in January at 47.6587, -122.4050, which
 * makes it a genuine test rather than a smoke check: seven of its nine species
 * are ordinary there and must carry NO mark, while Blue Jay and Northern
 * Cardinal are eastern birds absent from the Pacific Northwest.
 *
 * Asserting the absences matters more than asserting the marks. A resolver that
 * marked everything, or one that silently failed and marked nothing, would each
 * pass half of this.
 *
 * Ground truth here is the same asset ml/distill/verify_rarity_blob.py checks
 * against known distributions.
