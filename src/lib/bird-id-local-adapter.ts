/**
 * Local (on-device) bird identification, drop-in for identifyBirdInPhoto.
 *
 * Same signature and same BirdIdResult shape as the server path in
 * ai-inference.ts, so AddPhotosFlow keeps calling one function and the swap is
 * a routing decision rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * THREE FIELDS THE SERVER RETURNED AND THIS CANNOT (see G21):
 *
 *   cropBox        GPT returned birdCenter and birdSize. A classifier sees the
 *                  whole frame and localises nothing. Left undefined, so the
 *                  auto-crop preview simply never appears.
 *   multipleBirds  Nothing here counts birds. Left undefined. The user knows
 *                  better than a threshold does.
 *   empty results  The server returned zero candidates for "no bird". A
 *                  classifier ALWAYS returns 25 ranked species, so an empty
 *                  list can never mean "no bird found" ON ITS OWN. That is now
 *                  supplied by an explicit abstention signal rather than by an
 *                  empty list: the bird/not-bird probe below returns P(bird),
 *                  and identifyBirdLocally drops the candidates when it falls
 *                  under BIRD_PROBE.threshold. The AddPhotosFlow empty state is
 *                  therefore REACHABLE on this path.
 *
 *                  The probe is fitted in the shipped int8 embedding space.
 *                  With alpha fixed at 0.60, fp32-to-int8 threshold transfer
 *                  moves the bird flag rate by at most 0.18 pp.
 *
 * CONFIDENCE. `confidence` is the post-rerank softmax, which is what the gate
 * should read. Measured on the 3,322-photo validation split: at 0.7 it keeps
 * 94.9% of photos at 97.91% accuracy, against 52.1% / 97.81% for a vision-only
 * gate. So prompting below 0.7 asks the user about roughly 5% of uploads.

 *           an fp32 number and drifting; raw 0.1032229138 maps through the
 *           Platt pair to this value. Measured at that point: 0.45% of
 *           validation birds flagged, 74.10% of hard negatives rejected,
 *           84.90% of Imagenette rejected, and 0.0375% of the 8,000 NABirds

 *           against 93.95% ungated, so the gate costs 0.27 pp of accuracy.
 *
 *           Per 1,000 uploads that is about 4 real birds wrongly sent to the
 *           empty state and about 740 hard non-birds caught.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT MEASURED TO DO. 74% hard-negative rejection is an UPPER
 * BOUND for non-bird types the probe never saw. Rejection measured across
