/**
 * Local (on-device) bird identification, drop-in for identifyBirdInPhoto.

 * Same signature and same BirdIdResult shape as the server path in
 * ai-inference.ts, so AddPhotosFlow keeps calling one function and the swap is
 * a routing decision rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * THREE FIELDS THE SERVER RETURNED AND THIS CANNOT (see G21):
 *
 *   cropBox        GPT returned birdCenter and birdSize. A classifier sees the
 *                  whole frame and localises nothing. Left undefined, so the
 *                  auto-crop preview simply never appears.
 *   multipleBirds  Nothing here counts birds. Left undefined. The user knows
 *                  better than a threshold does.
 *   empty results  The server returned zero candidates for "no bird". A
 *                  classifier ALWAYS returns 25 ranked species, so an empty
 *                  list can never mean "no bird found". Callers must switch to
 *                  the confidence gate below.
 *
 * CONFIDENCE. `confidence` is the post-rerank softmax, which is what the gate
 * should read. Measured on the 3,322-photo validation split: at 0.7 it keeps
 * 94.9% of photos at 97.91% accuracy, against 52.1% / 97.81% for a vision-only
 * gate. So prompting below 0.7 asks the user about roughly 5% of uploads.
