### Features

### Miscellaneous Chores
- Initial commit ([13403ed](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/13403ed))
- Generated by Spark: Build a mobile-first web app called “Bird-Dex” that is its own bird life-list + sighting tracker, and is compatible with eBird (import/export) and Merlin (Merlin-like life list UX + optional eBird bridge). ([0e67380](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/0e67380))
- Generated by Spark: Fix all reported errors. ([13e67e9](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/13e67e9))
- Generated by Spark: How is the list stored? Just on the VM? Or can we have the list be stored in the user GitHub profile, maybe as a gist that could be either public or private? ([d73d091](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/d73d091))
- Generated by Spark: Ok first the outing identification should be automatic via EXIF ([1c8009b](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/1c8009b))
- Generated by Spark: The cropping didn't happen. The birds were not identified. The outing parsing also didn't work, it should mention a place and then ask the user to confirm or edit ([b917f0f](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/b917f0f))
- Generated by Spark: Ok still no cropping and still no bird ID ([2621561](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/2621561))
- Generated by Spark: Why is there still no crop? Are we doing AI crop? I was thinking user crop. Maybe it could be AI crop first and then user confirm? ([ddab6d4](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/ddab6d4))
- Edited Spark ([6dcd4ef](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/6dcd4ef))
- Generated by Spark: I'm still not seeing a crop box or any indication of AI crop ([250f892](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/250f892))
- Generated by Spark: Nope, all the same issues I just mentioned none are fixed, no crop, no outing location detection, and no bird ID ([e132657](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/e132657))
- Edited Spark ([aa1289d](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/aa1289d))
- Generated by Spark: Alright I was just in code spaces making a bunch of changes. Now can you just commit it ([ce1e3da](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/ce1e3da))
- Edited Spark ([4240782](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/4240782))
- Generated by Spark: Please commit ([bd76c39](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/bd76c39))
- Edited Spark ([b87b4e5](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/b87b4e5))
- Generated by Spark: Please commit we fixed the storage situation. Why is it not possible to commit in the codespace ([acd4d27](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/acd4d27))
- Edited Spark ([1336bea](https://github.com/jlian/birddex/commit/1336bea))
