/**
 * Reverse geocode a coordinate from the local OSM archive.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO external provider here. The archive covers 93.2% of
 * coordinates (measured over 20,000 iNaturalist points) and the remaining gap
 * returns null, which the app already handles: OutingReview renders "No named
 * place found nearby. Tap above to name this outing." and leaves the field
 * editable.
 *
 * Returning null beats calling a paid provider for the last few percent. It
 * removes the provider API key, provider quota, provider deadline and
 * third-party network hop from the path. WingDex still applies its own abuse
 * limit, and clients retain their request timeout. A wrong-but-confident
 * address is worse for naming a birding outing than an honest blank.
 *
 * The archive has no third-party quota, but R2 reads and Worker CPU are still
 * finite resources. A dedicated limiter protects them without allowing reverse
 * traffic to consume the separate Geoapify search budget.
